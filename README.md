# AWS Step Function Talk
This was a talk I did at Northwestern DevIT's January 2020 meeting.

It was created in [Marp](https://marp.app/), a Markdown-powered slide thing that you can use right from VS Code.

The slides are available in the [Marp markdown](slides.md) format or as a [PDF](./slides.pdf).
